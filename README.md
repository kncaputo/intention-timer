[Deployed Site](https://peytonjo.github.io/iteration-timer/)
Iteration Timer is a website that allows users to choose a Activity Category, specifiy an objective to achieve and the desired time to accomplish said objective. Users can save and view the record of past activities in the past activity column.  

Each cover consists of a:
1. Cover image
2. title
3. Tagline with two descriptors
Generated covers can be viewed individually, or saved and then displayed with other saved covers.

### Iteration 0 - Main Form Page
Objective - When the page loads, we should see a page titled Intention Timer with input fields to be filled out by the user.
When the user completes the form and each field has been filled out appropriately (this can be ensured by the lack of error messages) the user should be taken to a new page when "Start activity" is clicked.
The buttons displayed on the main page are:
* Study
* Meditate
* Exercise
* Start Activity

Objectives
